You may have read the guide on [saving and storing data](./saving_data.md), which covers how to export data to a save file and have it persist between runs. This tutorial covers a similar concept that can be combined with the knowledge of saving data: creating data associated with objects.

## ``GetData`` and its drawbacks

Isaac provides a simple way of storing data within entities: a method known as [GetData](https://wofsauge.github.io/IsaacDocs/rep/Entity.html?h=getdata#getdata). Utilizing `GetData` is quite simple, as it can be referenced from any kind of `Entity`. `GetData` simply returns a table which can be used to store any amount of arbitrary data and access it later.

Although `GetData` is convenient, it has several drawbacks which should be taken into consideration by modders. [The docs](https://wofsauge.github.io/IsaacDocs/rep) [provide some reasoning for this](https://wofsauge.github.io/IsaacDocs/rep/Entity.html?h=getdata#getdata), citing that the data table is shared, volatile, and will require its own saving and storing regardless of it being a feature of the API, but these can be upsides depending on the use case. Here are a few additional drawbacks:

### Performance issues

- `GetData` creates a small amount of overhead when called. Because it is calling the C++ side, it disrupts the flow of code. Storing the tables on the Lua side would allow for better flow and management of code. Additionally, this overhead can stack up if the method is called consistently. If you still wish to use `GetData`, avoid calling it multiple times within the same function, and structure your code to be able to pass it to lower level functions instead of calling the method again.
- `GetData` does some amount of memory allocation on the C++ side, meaning its impact on performance can range depending on the speed and state of the user's memory.

### Unexpected behavior

- `GetData` does not account for items such as Glowing Hourglass. It may be hard to store a backup of data, as it must either be done in a sub-table or already stored locally.
- `GetData` is erased from an entity on [`MC_POST_ENTITY_REMOVE`](https://wofsauge.github.io/IsaacDocs/rep/enums/ModCallbacks.html#mc_post_entity_remove), which runs before [`MC_POST_NPC_DEATH`](https://wofsauge.github.io/IsaacDocs/rep/enums/ModCallbacks.html#mc_post_npc_death). 

Depending on the use case, `GetData` may still fit the needs of the modder, providing the convenience of being able to store smaller and simpler data that doesn't necessarily need to be scalable or need a complicated system. In cases where data needs to be scalable or there are issues of performance, it may be worth writing a simple system to store data locally on the Lua side.

## Entity data holders

Conversely, writing a entity data holder has many upsides:

- Because the system is in the user's control, the user can control when the data is cleared.
- It can handle specific and custom behavior, such as behavior for instantiation, or whenever the data is cleared.
- Any issues or edge cases can be handled by the system through custom behavior.

While writing a entity data holder is fairly straightforward, there are still a few considerations:

- The user must find a way to store the data in relation to specific entities or objects. [`GetPtrHash`](https://wofsauge.github.io/IsaacDocs/rep/GlobalFunctions.html#getptrhash) is a good starting point, but has several issues: Because `GetPtrHash` returns a hash based on a pointer, when that memory is eventually cleared, the pointer will be reused. This means that if data is not cleared ahead of time, a new entity or object may reference the data of an old object by accident.
- The data must be cleared manually, otherwise it will continue to stack up and cause a memory leak. This is also important for avoiding the previous issue. 

In cases where writing a data holder might not be worth the time and effort or seems undesirable, it may be worth sticking to `GetData`.

### Writing a data holder

To get started, simply create a new Lua file:
```lua
local dataHolder = {}

-- We will store the data within its own table in the data holder for easy access
dataHolder.Data = {}

function dataHolder:GetEntityData(entity)
    -- We obtain the entity's pointer hash to easily reference it in a table
    local ptrHash = GetPtrHash(entity)
    -- Here we instantiate the data if it doesn't exist
    if not dataHolder.Data[ptrHash] then
        dataHolder.Data[ptrHash] = {}
        local entityData = dataHolder.Data[ptrHash]

        --[[
            We provide a default value of the entity's pointer to the data.
            The pointer helps us later be able to check if the entity exists

            For looping purposes, it may be inconvenient to store it here.
            If this is the case, making another table to store the pointer
            may be preferable. 
        --]] 
        entityData.Pointer = EntityPtr(entity)

        -- You may also add additional initialization steps here
        -- This may include defining default variables for your data:

        -- entityData.customValue = false
    end

    -- Finally, we return the data itself
    return dataHolder.Data[ptrHash]
end

return dataHolder
```

As it is just a holder, you may `require` this Lua file so that the data is persistent across the project. Using `include` would make the data local to the file you are including it in. See the ["Additional lua files"](./additional_lua_files.md) article for more information about the differences between the two.

We use an [EntityPtr](https://wofsauge.github.io/IsaacDocs/rep/EntityPtr.html) object to keep track of the entity. Storing the entity directly can cause unexpected behavior, such as the variable pointing to a different entity when the initial one is removed. `EntityPtr` is much safer and also clears its `Ref` property automatically when the entity no longer exists. You can check for if `Ref` is `nil` to see if the entity still exists.

### Clearing data in your holder

Lastly, we will cover removing and clearing custom data. Additional callbacks should be registered to clear the information after specified events. Depending on the use case, this can range from clearing data when entities are removed directly in `MC_POST_ENTITY_REMOVE`, clearing data when the entity is fully dead in `MC_POST_NPC_DEATH`, or clearing entity data at the end of the room with `MC_POST_NEW_ROOM`.

Below is an example of how to clear custom data on [`MC_POST_NEW_ROOM`](https://wofsauge.github.io/IsaacDocs/rep/enums/ModCallbacks.html#mc_post_new_room):

```lua
-- Provide your data holder to be able to clear it
local dataHolder = require("path.to.data_holder")

-- For clearing custom data on MC_POST_NEW_ROOM
function MOD_REFERENCE:ClearCustomData()
    -- Loop through the table of stored data
    for ptrHash, entityData in pairs(dataHolder.Data) do
        -- Check if the entity's pointer exists
        local entityPointer = entityData.Pointer

        -- If the pointer doesn't exist, or the entity's reference doesn't exist
        if not (entityPointer and entityPointer.Ref) then
            -- We know the entity doesn't exist anymore, therefore remove its data
            entityData.Data[ptrHash] = nil
        end
    end
end
MOD_REFERENCE:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_NEW_ROOM, MOD_REFERENCE.ClearCustomData)
```

Similarly, the following code clears entity data on removal or death:

```lua
-- Provide your data holder to be able to clear it
local dataHolder = require("path.to.data_holder")

function MOD_REFERENCE:ClearDataOnRemoveOrDeath(entity)
    -- Get the pointer hash of the current entity
    local ptrHash = GetPtrHash(entity)
    -- Set the data to nil. This works even if it had no data prior
    dataHolder.Data[ptrHash] = nil
end
MOD_REFERENCE:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_ENTITY_REMOVE, MOD_REFERENCE.ClearDataOnRemoveOrDeath)
-- Alternatively clear it when the NPC_DEATH callback is run
-- MOD_REFERENCE:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_POST_NPC_DEATH, MOD_REFERENCE.ClearDataOnRemoveOrDeath)
```
