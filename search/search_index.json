The id value should be the same one the item has defined in its <code>items.xml</code> entry. <code>id=\"1\"</code> flameColor string The color of the wisp's flame. Uses the name of a color tag defined earlier in the file. <code>flameColor=\"flame_blue\"</code> coreColor string The color of the wisp's core. Uses the name of a color tag defined earlier in the file. <code>coreColor=\"core_blue\"</code> tearColor string The color of the tears shot by the wisp. Uses the name of a color tag defined earlier in the file. <code>tearColor=\"tear_blue\"</code> coreGfx string Changes the appearance of the wisp's core. Uses a file path to a .png that is relative to the location defined by the parent <code>wisps</code> tag's <code>gfxroot</code>. <code>coreGfx=\"cross.png\"</code> hp float Defines the wisp's maximum hitpoints. Each projectile the wisp blocks causes it to lose 1 hp, while taking contact damage causes it to lose 2 hp. Default wisps have an hp value of 2. When deciding on an hp value for your wisp, keep in mind that vanilla active items with lower charge tend to have lower max hp, while higher charge or single use actives have higher max hp. <code>hp=\"3\"</code> damage float Defines the damage the wisp's tears deal. Default is 3. This value does not affect the amount of damage wisps deal on contact with enemies. <code>damage=\"5.5\"</code> layer integer (-1, 0, 1, or 2) Defines how close the wisp orbits the player. Default is 1. A layer value of 2 will cause it to orbit at a further distance, while a value of 0 will cause it to orbit closer. A layer value of -1 will instead cause the wisp to not follow or orbit the player. If a layer attribute isn't present, it will default to 1. Entering any other positive value will cause the game to crash when the wisp attempts to be spawned. <code>layer=\"0\"</code> count integer Defines the number of wisps that should be spawned when the associated active item is used. Default is 1. <code>count=\"2\"</code> canShoot boolean Defines whether the wisp shoots tears or not. Default is <code>true</code>. <code>canShoot=\"false\"</code> fireDelay integer Defines the cooldown in game ticks (30 ticks per second) before wisp can fire again after shooting a tear. This system works in a similar way to the player's MaxFireDelay stat, which is explained further in this article. Default is 30. Wisps with a <code>fireDelay</code> value less than 0 effectively act the same as ones with <code>canShoot=\"false\"</code>. <code>fireDelay=\"45\"</code> (The wisp will shoot 1.5x slower compared to a default wisp.) shotSpeed float Defines the shot speed of the wisp's tears. The stat works similarly to the player's shot speed stat. Default is 1. <code>shotSpeed=\"0.75\"</code> tearFlags integer Defines what tear effect(s) the wisp's tears will have. A full list of what number corresponds to what tear effect can be referenced off of the <code>TearFlags</code> page on the docs. Multiple numbers can be inputted in this field, with a space separating each effect. <code>tearFlags=\"2 34\"</code> (This wisp will shoot homing, shielded tears.) tearScale float Controls the size of the wisp's tears. Default is 0.7. <code>tearScale=\"1.2\"</code> tearVariant integer Defines the appearance and behavior of the wisp's tears. A full list of what number corresponds to what tear variant can be referenced off of the <code>TearVariant</code> page on the docs. <code>tearVariant=\"28\"</code> (The wisp's tears will look like razors.) tearFlags2 integer Operates identically to the <code>tearFlags</code> attribute, but the defined tear effect will only have a chance to be shot by the wisp, controlled by the <code>procChance</code> attribute. <code>tearFlags2=\"4 22\"</code> (This wisp will have a chance to shoot tears that apply poison and burn.) procChance float Controls the chance for tear effects defined by the <code>tearFlags2</code> attribute to be fired. <code>procChance=\"0.25\"</code> (The wisp will have a 25% chance to shoot a tear with <code>tearFlags2</code>'s effects.) tearColor2 string Operates identically to the <code>tearColor</code> attribute, but only affects tears with the effects of the <code>tearFlags2</code> attribute. Uses the name of a color tag defined earlier in the file. <code>tearColor2=\"tear_green\"</code> tearScale2 float Operates identically to the <code>tearScale</code> attribute, but only affects tears with the effects of the <code>tearFlags2</code> attribute. <code>tearScale2=\"0.5\"</code> damageMultiplier2 float Multiplies the damage that a tear with the tear effects defined by the <code>tearFlags2</code> attribute will deal. <code>damageMultiplier2=\"1.5\"</code> (The wisp's tears with <code>tearFlags2</code>'s effects will also deal 1.5x damage.) priority integer Controls the wisp's priority value. When wisps with the same layer are spawned by Book of Virtues while that layer has reached its cap of wisps, the newly spawned wisp will replace the oldest wisp. The priority attribute overrides this behavior, so that wisps with a priority of -1 are prioritized to be replaced instead, and wisps with a priority of 1 or more are replaced only after no wisps with a lower priority value can be replaced.

This means that you can flip the sign of the X and Y values of a number to be negative to positive, or positive to negative. <code>-Vector(2, -2)</code> = <code>Vector(-2, 2)</code> <p>Beyond basic arithmetic, sometimes it is necessary to want to resize or rotate vectors, among other common forms of vector manipulation. The modding API has many functions that you can use on <code>Vector</code> objects to avoid doing the math for this yourself. Below is a table going over all the basic vector manipulation functions.</p> Function Description Example <code>Distance</code> This can tell you the distance between two vectors that represent a position in 2D space in units. <code>Vector(2, 0):Distance(Vector(4, 0))</code> = <code>2</code> <code>DistanceSquared</code> The same as <code>Distance</code>, but returns the distance in squared units. This is function has slightly less overhead than <code>Distance</code>, as the game doesn't need to calculate the square root. <code>Vector(2, 0):DistanceSquared(Vector(4, 0))</code> <code>GetAngleDegrees</code> Returns a number representing the direction a vector is pointing in, in degrees. This is relative towards the right, meaning that right is an angle of 0, down is an angle of -90, up is an angle of 90, and left is an angle of 180 or -180. <code>Vector(5, 0):GetAngleDegrees)</code> = <code>0</code> <code>Normalized</code> Returns a vector normalized to be a unit vector, meaning it returns purely the direction the vector is pointing in and nothing else. <code>Vector(2, 2)</code> = <code>Vector(0.707, 0.707)</code> <code>Resized</code> Returns a vector normalized and then resized by a certain amount of units. This is useful over simply multiplying a vector, as it allows you to resize a vector of any length without needing to normalize it yourself first. <code>Vector(15, 0):Resized(3)</code> = <code>Vector(15, 0):Normalized() * 3</code> = <code>Vector(3, 0)</code> <code>Rotated</code> Returns a vector rotated by a certain amount of degrees. This will usually have some floating point imprecisions attached. This means that instead of exactly 0, you may receive a number like <code>-4.37114e-08</code>, which is <code>-0.0000000437114</code> in standard form. <code>Vector(1, 0):Rotated(90)</code> = <code>Vector(0, 1)</code> (excluding any floating point imprecisions) <p><code>Normalized</code>, <code>Rotated</code>, <code>Resized</code> all have counterparts without the \"d\" at the end which alter the original vector itself instead of returning the result. <pre><code>local vec = Vector(2, 0)\nvec:Rotate(90)\n\nprint(vec) -- Vector(0, 2)\n</code></pre></p> <p>Lastly, there's also a static function that's a part of the <code>Vector</code> class that lets you create a unit vector from a specific angle in degrees. The way you call this function works a little differently than normal. Observe the following example: <pre><code>local angle = 90\nlocal v1 = Vector.FromAngle(angle) -- Notice how we use a period (.) instead of a colon (:) here!\n\nprint(v1) -- Vector(0, 1)\n</code></pre></p>","tags":["Tutorial","Intermediate","Repentance","Repentance+","Lua"]},{"location":"tutorials/concepts/vector_math/#advanced-vector-manipulation","title":"Advanced vector manipulation","text":"<p>While the most common forms of vector manipulation have already been covered, there are further forms of manipulation you can do with more advanced functions.

In our case, it lets us get a position between two vectors.</p> <p>Before talking about linear interpolation with vectors, first it's important to understand how it applies with basic numbers. Observe the following example: <pre><code>function lerp(a, b, percent)\n    return a * (1 - percent) + b * percent\nend\n\nlocal halfWay = lerp(0, 2, 0.5)\nprint(halfWay) -- 1\n</code></pre></p> <p>With the above code, we have used the linear interpolation formula calculated with the <code>lerp()</code> function. This formula takes the starting number <code>a</code>, the ending number <code>b</code>, and a target percentage between the two numbers. Remember that percentages are represented with a decimal multiplied by 100, so 0.5 is the same as 50%. 50% of the way from 0 to 2 is 1, and that's what we got from the function.</p> <p></p> <p>Linear interpolation is a very important concept to understand for lots of math in programming, but how do we apply it to vectors? The modding API provides a <code>Lerp()</code> function we can call on a vector. This changes the vector it's used on and does not provide a new, altered version of the vector. <pre><code>local v1 = Vector(0, 0)\nlocal v2 = Vector(1, 1)\nv1:Lerp(v2, 0.5) -- v1 equals Vector(0.5, 0.5) now\n</code></pre></p> <p>If you don't want to alter the vector you're calling this function on (<code>v1</code> in this example), you should use the <code>lerp</code> function provided earlier. <pre><code>function lerp(a, b, percent)\n    return a * (1 - percent) + b * percent\nend\n\nlocal v1 = Vector(0, 0)\nlocal v2 = Vector(1, 1)\n\nlocal v3 = lerp(v1, v2, 0.5) -- v3 equals Vector(0.5, 0.5), while v1 and v2 are still the same\n</code></pre></p>","tags":["Tutorial","Intermediate","Repentance","Repentance+","Lua"]},{"location":"tutorials/concepts/vector_math/#dot-product","title":"Dot product","text":"<p>The dot product between two vectors can be explained as the amount that the first vector is pointing in the same direction as the second vector.

These do not replace normal bombs. completionparent string Used for characters that have shared completion marks with a preexistent character, like Dark Judas and Judas. The name of the parent character should be used for this attribute. nomarks bool If it has any value other than <code>false</code>, it will hide the completion marks for the given character. noshake bool Will prevent characters from shaking during stage/boss screen transition (similarly to Keeper) if set to <code>true</code>. achievement int or string This is now respected on modded characters. For mods, it's best to define this as the name of the achievement (for example, <code>achievement='TaintedPeter'</code>, TaintedPeter being the name attribute of the achievement). Characters with this tag should have a second frame in their <code>characterportraits(alt).anm2</code> which should be the \"locked\" picture for the character. In addition, all stat/item layers on the main menu will be hidden and the <code>Unlocked By</code> layer will be visible. See the REPENTOGON achievements XML section for more info. modcostume int Set this to match the <code>id</code> attribute of a costume with <code>type=\"none\"</code> defined in the same mod in <code>costumes2.xml</code> to have that costume permanantly applied to the character (including during the mineshaft chase sequence).

It is not necessarily required, but is convenient for most use-cases. The function takes the following arguments:</p> <ol> <li>What familiar variant to spawn.</li> <li>How many familiars are expected to be present.</li> <li>An RNG object for determining its <code>InitSeed</code>.</li> <li>An ItemConfigItem object for linking an item to the spawned familiar. This is necessary for Sacrifical Altar to function properly, but is technically optional.</li> <li>An integer to spawn a specific <code>SubType</code> of familiar. This is optional, and by default spawns familiars with a subtype of <code>0</code>.</li> </ol> <p>The familiar variant is already stored earlier in the lua file. For the number of familiars to spawn, this can be any number you'd like, but the most common example is how many copies of the item Isaac has combined with the number of TemporaryEffects of the item. The purpose of the latter is for items such as Box of Friends, where it will add a <code>TemporaryEffect</code> of your familiar item to spawn a copy of your familiar without needing to own the item.</p> CheckFamiliar and RNG <p>The <code>RNG</code> object passed into <code>CheckFamiliar</code> is used for the familiar's <code>InitSeed</code>, which is often used by modders as a unique identifier for each individual familiar.</p> <p><code>CheckFamiliar</code> is bugged in that it will get new seeds from the RNG object provided without actually changing the object. This means that if you use <code>CheckFamiliar</code> to spawn 3 new familiars at once, they will all have different seeds, but the RNG object will still have the seed it started with. However, if you use <code>CheckFamiliar</code> to spawn one familiar 3 separate times (like Box of Friends), they'll all have the same seed.</p> <p>A simple way to fix this is to either advance the RNG object manually for each familiar spawned, or to just provide a unique RNG object to <code>CheckFamiliar</code> every time you use it.

The XML stats are implemented in a way for better accuracy to vanilla stats compared to the Lua callback, so it is strongly recommended that you use the new XML item stats features instead of this callback whenever possible!</p> <pre><code>local mod = RegisterMod(\"Demon Locket Mod\", 1)\n\nlocal DEMON_LOCKET = Isaac.GetItemIdByName(\"Demon Locket\")\nlocal DEMON_LOCKET_DAMAGE_UP = 0.7\n\nfunction mod:DemonLocketDamageUp(player, statStage, value)\n    if player:HasCollectible(DEMON_LOCKET) then\n        return value + (player:GetBlackHearts() * DEMON_LOCKET_DAMAGE_UP)\n    end\nend\n\nmod:AddCallback(ModCallbacks.MC_EVALUATE_STAT, mod.DemonLocketDamageUp, EvaluateStatStage.DAMAGE_UP)\n</code></pre>","tags":["Tutorial","Intermediate","Lua","XML","Repentance+","REPENTOGON"]},{"location":"tutorials/shaders/shader_basics/","title":"Shader basics","text":"Work in progress! <p>This article is a work in progress!

Unlike other aspects of Isaac modding, shaders are not programmed in Lua. It is therefore recommended that you have prior experience with programming, or are willing to look into the specifications of the GLSL Programming Language, which Isaac uses for writing shaders.</p> Technical Information <p>At their core, shaders are just a way of sending instructions to the graphics card. Though only fragment and vertex type shaders can be written for Isaac modding, different types of shaders are used in other applications for more advanced techniques, such as parallel processing.</p> <p>You can learn more about shaders and their applications here.</p> <p>GLSL is very similar to C-like languages, with a few key differences such as swizzling and (something else I'll remember later), but if you are comfortable working in C or any languages like it, it may be easy enough to work with.

A shader works in two parts, a fragment and a vertex shader. As the Vertex shader is not as important (asterisk, but we'll get there), we will start with the Fragment shader:</p> <pre><code>// A color \"tint\" variable.\nvarying lowp vec4 Color0;\n\n// A normalized coordinate variable.\nvarying mediump vec2 TexCoord0;\n\n// Information about the render screen (which will be explained later).\nvarying lowp vec4 RenderDataOut;\n\n// Information about the render scale.\nvarying lowp float ScaleOut;\n\n// A sample of the screen's image.\nuniform sampler2D Texture0;\n\n/* \n    All aforementioned variables are provided by the game.\n    Failure to include them in your shader may cause issues.\n\n    More information is available below this code snippet.\n*/\n\n// The main function, where you would write your code.\nvoid main(void)\n{\n    // A base color value, getting the color of the current pixel\n    vec4 Color = Color0 * texture2D(Texture0, TexCoord0);\n\n    // gl_FragColor, which returns the color to the screen \n    gl_FragColor = Color;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The fragment shader's job is simply to output a color. It does this for every pixel of the screen. The <code>sampler2D</code> parameter is automatically provided to the shader with a sample of the screen's image. It samples the image using the built in <code>texture2D</code> function that intakes <code>TexCoord0</code> as the position of the shader. All of these parameters are automatically provided by the game.</p> Technical Information <p>Fragment shaders don't always run on every single pixel. This is only true because the shaders we are trying to make affect screenspace. </p> <p>With  REPENTOGON, it is possible to create shaders that affect only a specific sprite or area instead of the whole screen, but they are outside the scope of shader basics.</p> <p>The notable thing about <code>TexCoord0</code> is that it is a normalized 2D Vector. This means its values will only ever range from 0 to 1 in both directions.</p> <p></p> <p>Other provided values include <code>Color0</code>, which for screen-space shaders should always be white with full alpha. GLSL Color values are <code>vec4</code>, comparable to that of the Color class the game uses, where values are <code>(R, G, B, A)</code>.</p> <p>Finally, the <code>gl_FragColor</code> value returns whatever color it is set to as the output for the current pixel. It is reserved by the shader, and will always be the output value of the pixel.</p> Warning <p>A fragment shader must always set <code>gl_FragColor</code>. Not doing so will lead to unexpected results that differ between graphics cards.</p> <p>These effects can range from doing nothing and defaulting to black, to seizure inducing rapid color flashes depending on the graphics card.</p>","tags":["Tutorial","Advanced","Repentance","Repentance+","XML"]},{"location":"tutorials/shaders/shader_resources/","title":"Shader resources","text":"Work in progress! <p>This article is a work in progress!
